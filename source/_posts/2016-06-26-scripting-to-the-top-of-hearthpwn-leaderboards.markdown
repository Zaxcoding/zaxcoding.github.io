[Hearthpwn](http://www.hearthpwn.com) is a community Hearthstone site where most people go to find the latest decks to try their hand at making legend for the season.

Another feature on the site is the Hearth Pack Simulator, a fun little 'game' where you can try your luck at opening a random pack of Hearthstone cards. There are 8 different rarities to Hearthstone cards: common, rare, epic, and legendary (and golden variants of each), and each one gives a different 'score' on the Hearth Pack Simulator. Tens of millions of packs have been opened on the site and there is a leaderboard that keeps track of the daily/weekly/etc best packs opened. I decided I wanted to make it to the top of the leaderboard.

Did I make it to the top?
